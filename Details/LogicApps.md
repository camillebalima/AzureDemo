   * Receive an Http Request
   * Send an Http Response to github after push

# What I learned Logic Apps
* Allows us to create logical actions that will happen in a defined order automatically
* Has over 200 connectors to proceed those actions

# Conclusion
Since I did this demo after Azure Functions, it has been easier to do. I understand how useful it must be in a professional environment by processing tasks in the background automatically in some predefined use cases. I really enjoyed learning it.
